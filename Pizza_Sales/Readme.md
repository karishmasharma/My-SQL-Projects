# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis - SQL Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data using SQL to derive valuable business insights. The dataset includes various pizza orders, and we aim to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualize important trends.

In the SQL phase, we will extract, transform, and analyze the data. Later, we will integrate Power BI to create an interactive dashboard, which will be shared in a separate repository.

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

We will calculate the following metrics to measure business performance:

1️⃣ Total Revenue - The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.

2️⃣ Average Order Value - The average amount spent per order (Total Revenue / Total Orders).

3️⃣ Total Pizzas Sold - The total quantity of pizzas sold.

4️⃣ Total Orders - The total number of orders placed.

5️⃣ Average Pizzas Per Order - The average number of pizzas per order (Total Pizzas Sold / Total Orders).

## 📈 Charts & Visualization Requirements

Once the SQL analysis is complete, the next phase will involve data visualization in Power BI. The following charts will be created:

🔹 Sales Trend Analysis
📌 Daily Trend for Total Orders - A bar chart displaying daily sales trends.
📌 Monthly Trend for Total Orders - A line chart showing sales variations over time.

🔹 Sales Distribution
📌 Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category - A pie chart representing sales across different pizza categories.
📌 Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size - A pie chart analyzing customer preferences for pizza sizes.
📌 Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category - A funnel chart comparing different pizza categories.

🔹 Best & Worst Performers
📌 Top 5 Best-Selling Pizzas - A bar chart highlighting the most popular pizzas based on revenue, quantity, and orders.
📌 Bottom 5 Worst-Selling Pizzas - A bar chart identifying underperforming pizzas.
