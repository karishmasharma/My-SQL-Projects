# My-SQL-Projects
This repository contains a collection of SQL projects demonstrating my skills in data querying, database design, and data analysis. The projects include real-world datasets, complex queries, stored procedures, and data visualization using tools like Power BI. Each project is structured with clear documentation, including SQL scripts, dataset sources, and insights derived from the analysis.

Feel free to explore the projects, and any feedback is welcome!
